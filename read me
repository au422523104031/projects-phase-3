## Overview

This project applies **Association Rule Mining (ARM)** to customer transaction data to identify hidden patterns in purchasing behavior. These patterns help retailers optimize store layout, product bundling, promotions, and inventory strategies.

## Problem Statement

Retailers often struggle to understand complex customer purchasing behavior. By analyzing transactional data using the **Apriori algorithm**, this project extracts frequent itemsets and meaningful product associations.
